# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains files in fulfillment of the project in the Getting and Cleaning Data course which goal is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Files

### README.md
A markdown file which explains the contents of this repository.

### CodeBook.md
A markdown file which contains the variable list.

### run_analysis.R
R script used which performs the following:

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## About the Data
